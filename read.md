As a beginner in Data Engineering, you've been assigned a project in the task.md file. Below are the expectations or ;
1. You are expected to create a Jupyter Notebook that is used as an orchestration tool.
2. The strucutre of the project must follow etl pipeline(eg; extract.py, transform.py, load.py, etc). Also, a config file for sensitive data like api key, etc. There should only be one notebook (orchestrator). Make the codes beginner-friendly yet efficient.
3. Add retries, proper docstring, Clean Readme, annotate all diagrams, timeouts and structured logging. Add doctring. 
4. The orchestrator notebook shouldnt have a long code. It should be easy to read and understand. for example, it should have just one function for each step of the pipeline(eg. df_raw = extract()).
